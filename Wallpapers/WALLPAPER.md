# 📝 Guidelines for Wallpaper Submission 

1. **Design Philosophy**  
   - Every wallpaper should align with the **minimalist aesthetic** of WallGodds.  
   - Keep it clean, inspiring, and user-focused.  
   - Use neutral tones, geometric patterns, or subtle gradients to fit the project's theme.

2. **Naming Convention**  
   - Name your file using the format:  
     ```
     [YourName]_[PullRequestNumber].jpg
     ```
     Example: `JaneDoe_101.jpg`  

3. **Folder Structure**  
   - Save your wallpapers in the `wallpapers/<Catagories>` folder.
   - If the folder is not already created, please create it. Categorize your wallpaper in the appropriate folder, such as
     - Abstract – (Abstract, Shapes, Gradient, Minimal)
     - Nature – (Nature, Plant, Rain, Animals, Beach)
     - Anime – (Manga, Otaku, Characters, Action)
     - Art – (Art, Exclusive, Stock)
     - Movies – (Superheroes, Shows)
     - Vehicles – (Car, Bike, Bicycle, Plane)
     - Sports – (Sports, Games)
     - Games – (Video Games)
     - Travel – (Travel, Beach, Plane again optionally)
     - Spiritual – (God, Spiritual-themed Abstracts)
     - Music – (Music, Concert, Instruments visuals)
     - AIGen - (AI-Created, Surreal, Futuristic, Dreamlike)
   - Ensure the file format is **.jpg** or **.png** for consistency.  

4. **Documentation in WALLPAPER.md**  
   - Add your wallpaper details in the main `WALLPAPER.md` file under the "Wallpapers" section:  
     - **Title**: Name of your wallpaper.  
     - **Description**: A brief explanation of your inspiration and thought process.
